# Galois_groups
File 1: Generates Cayley table given a polynomial of degree 5 or less. Aligns different numbers on the diagonal to better visualize other patterns/subgroups.

File 2: Generates the frobenius elements given a matrix.

File 3: Generates the symmetry cycles given a polynomial of degree 5 or less.
